PRACTICE SESSION DETAILS:
---------------------------------------


PUT YOUR NAME HERE:



For this part of the in-class exercise, you must complete the following tasks
alone, without collaboration.  You may use any materials provided by your
instructor, the code in your SVN repository and the course web site, but you
may not use other web sites or help from others.

1. Finish the code in part1.c.  Comments in that file will tell you what to do.

2. Create a program from scratch with the following specifications:

   * Its file name must be "process.c"
   * Add a rule for it to the Makefile to create "process" (the executable)
   * When run, it will read the text file specified on the command line and:
     1. Transpose it by the number passed to it 
        (HINT: copy your transpose functions into this file)
     2. print it to the screen (standard out)
     
    For example:
      pi@my-pi:$ cat test1.txt
      A big Fox.
      pi@my-pi:$ ./process test1.txt 2 > test1.decoded
       # file "test1.decoded" should contain "C dki Hqz."
      pi@my-pi:$ ./process test1.decoded 24
      A big Fox.
      pi@my-pi:$

   * we're providing you with two files you can use to test:
      test1.txt
      test2.txt (try with 6)

3. When you've got part 2 finished and you've tested it, use transpose on
   part3.txt with the number 12.  Follow the instructions you get in the
   decoded file.  

     ./transpose part3.txt 12

   --------------------------------------------------

When you're finished, be sure to add your code to SVN, then commit all your changes.
Also put your name on this document and give it to your instructor.
